"""Pydantic response models — the typed contracts for the JSON API.

Declaring these as path-operation return types lets FastAPI validate, document
(in ``/api/docs``), and serialize responses with pydantic-core (in Rust), which
is faster than hand-built ``JSONResponse`` payloads.

Every field here is part of the public wire contract consumed by the browser UI
(``app/templates/index.html``) and the stdlib CLI client (``client/htmlet.py``),
so do not rename or drop fields, and do not enable ``exclude_unset``/``exclude_none``.
